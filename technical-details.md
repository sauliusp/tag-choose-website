## System Requirements

### Chrome Version

**Important**: TagChoose will not work on Chrome versions below 138. The AI features require Chrome's stable Prompt API, which was introduced in Chrome 138.

### Hardware Requirements
Please refer to the [official Chrome AI requirements](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/ai/prompt-api) for detailed specifications:

- **Operating system**: Windows 10 or 11; macOS 13+ (Ventura and onwards); or Linux
- **Storage**: At least 22 GB on the volume that contains your Chrome profile
- **GPU**: Strictly more than 4 GB of VRAM
- **Network**: Unlimited data or an unmetered connection

**Note**: Chrome for Android, iOS, and ChromeOS are not yet supported by the AI APIs.

## Chrome Setup

**No setup required!** As of Chrome 138, TagChoose works out of the box without any experimental flags.

### For Chrome Versions Below 138
TagChoose is not compatible with Chrome versions below 138. Please update to Chrome 138 or higher to use the AI features.

## Troubleshooting

### Chrome Version Issues
If you're using Chrome below version 138:
