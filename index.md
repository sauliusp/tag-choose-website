## Too many folders. Still lost?

Most bookmark managers give you folders — and then leave you guessing where a link should go. The more organized you try to be, the more time you spend choosing the right folder... and still losing things. Even with subfolders, it becomes unsearchable chaos.

## Your brain works in tags. So should your bookmarks.

One page can belong to multiple topics. But the traditional bookmarking model forces you to choose just one folder.
#TagChoose solves this by letting you assign multiple AI-generated tags, each mapping to a real Chrome folder. One save = multiple placements.

It’s not magic — it’s client-side AI doing all the heavy lifting. The extension runs fully in your browser, powered by Google’s Gemini Nano, without sending your data to the cloud. That means:

- Performance
- No privacy trade-offs
- No need to sign up
- Works offline

## Tag once. File everywhere — with local AI.

Visit any page. Open the #TagChoose popup. The extension pulls the page title, favicon, and sends zero data anywhere. Then it runs a Gemini Nano model directly on your machine to suggest 2–3 relevant tags instantly.

Every tag maps to a folder in your bookmarks bar. You can edit the title, accept the tags, or choose your own.

The difference?
There’s no delay, no external server, and no risk of data leaving your browser. Unlike traditional AI assistants, TagChoose is lightweight and local — optimized for performance and privacy.

## Find it wherever it belongs. Always.

You don’t have to remember where you saved it — just what it was about.
Whether you're searching for i.e. "https://vercel.com/templates/ai" through "Startups", "AI Templates", or "AI Tools", your bookmark will be there.

This is what makes TagChoose more than just another Bookmark Manager. It’s a true AI Bookmark Manager, built to file things the way you think — in parallel, not in a hierarchy.

The best part?
It’s fast. It’s private. And it works offline.

#TagChoose is an AI Bookmark Manager for Chrome that does the thinking for you — without ever touching the cloud.
Designed for devs, researchers, founders, and everyday power users, it streamlines your workflow and simplifies your retrieval.

No signup. No sync.
Just your browser, your bookmarks, and a local AI working for you.
